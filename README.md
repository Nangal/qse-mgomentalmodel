# qse-mgomentalmodel
A Qlik Sense extension that creates Mental Model style diagrams (spaces, towers and boxes). These are 3 dimension based hierarchically nested visualisations. This was initially developed to work with [Indi Young's](http://indiyoung.com/) user research Mental Models (example uses her Dog Mental Model), but can be used whenever you want to visualise nested dimensions. I've used it to visual display JIRA items (Scenarios > Epics > User Stories).
